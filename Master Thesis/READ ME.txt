# Master Thesis - Quantum Annealing

In this repo you may find:
* Jupyter Notebooks, which one could consider the `main` files, each one focusing on a different aspect to compare;
* python files, aka libraries used in the Notebooks;
* repository with the Notebook in pdf format and other useful stuff (e.g., images).

It's still a work in progress, so in the notebooks and the python libraries there are a few notes about stuff to fix, but it's mainly about theory and presentation, the code is already stable.

Credits: the functions, methods, and classes in the file 'article_lib.py' are taken from the original github repo by the authors of the article (I'll add the link later on). The same holds true for the files 'examples_anf.py' and 'examples_nnf.py'.

Everything else, even though inspired from their work, has been written from scratch by me.
